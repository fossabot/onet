## Spaces

A `space` refers to a directory that houses a number of files that hold content.

Each space is described in the `spaces.json` file, with each having the following attributes:
    * `id`: A GUID that identifies it uniquely from all the other Onet Spaces in the world (or at least on your computer)
    * `name`: The directory that the space's files is contained in
    * `default`: A true/false value which specifies if this is the default space or not
    * `type`: The type of store that the content is placed in. See [Stores Overview](../repository/stores-overview.md)
