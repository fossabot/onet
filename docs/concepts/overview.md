## Concepts

An Onet installation is referred to as a `repository`.  Each repository has at least one [space](spaces.md).

I'm thinking of organizing the communication in a [transaction model](transactions.md).

Interacting with your repository is done through the command line or with a viewer.

Onet uses a client/server model, or direct connections are allowed too.

See [Clients](clients.md) and [Servers](servers.md).
